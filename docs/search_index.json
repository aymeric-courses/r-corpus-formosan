You do not need any particular background. This tutorial will start with the very basics. If you are already familiar with coding and/or the RStudio interface, it will of course be easier for you. 1.2.2 2- Which public? Anyone interested in Formosan languages[1] is welcome to take this tutorial, regardless if you are an undergraduate or graduate student, research assistant or just curious about quantitative methods and Formosan languages. 1.3 News Note: The webpage of this tutorial has just been created. That’s why it looks quite empty and some pages not at their right place. Stay tuned for further developments! [1] I use the term ‘Formosan languages’ as the Austronesian languages from Taiwan, including Yami (even though from a typological perspective, Yami is not a Formosan language). "],["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 2. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 4. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!
